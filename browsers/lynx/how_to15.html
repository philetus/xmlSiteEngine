<blockquote>To create a new category, <a href="how_to2.html">go to the configure site page</a>. Follow the &#39;new&#39; link next to the category heading.<br />
<br />
Enter your name and password at the prompt.<br />
<br />
In the &#39;name&#39; field, enter the name of the new category. The name should not include any spaces or special characters.<br />
<br />
The &#39;member&#39; field has three subfields, &#39;type&#39;, &#39;title&#39; and &#39;user&#39;. The &#39;type&#39; subfield is required. Enter the singular name of a member of the category. For example, a member of the people category is a person. If you want records in this category to have titles, enter the name of the title in the &#39;title&#39; subfield. The title for a person record is &#39;name&#39;. Enter &#39;true&#39; in the &#39;user&#39; subfield if records in this category represent users that should have passwords to access the site.<br />
<br />
The &#39;sort&#39; field controls the way records in the category are sorted. Enter the field whose contents you want to sort the records by in the &#39;field&#39; subfield. In the &#39;type&#39; field you should enter which sorting algorithm you would like to use. The options are &#39;cmp&#39;, &#39;last&#39; or &#39;date&#39;. The &#39;cmp&#39; algorithm compares the contents of the field alphabetically or numerically. The &#39;last&#39; algorithm is the same as &#39;cmp&#39; except it compares only the last word in the string. The &#39;date&#39; algorithm sorts the records by date, when the field mentioned in &#39;field&#39; has the attributes &#39;month&#39;, &#39;day&#39;, and &#39;year&#39; and they are in &#39;mm.dd.yyyy&#39; format. So if you wanted to sort the people category by last name you would put &#39;name&#39; in the &#39;field&#39; subfield and &#39;last&#39; in the &#39;type&#39; subfield. To sort people by their phone area code you put &#39;contact.phone.area_code&#39; in &#39;field&#39; and &#39;cmp&#39; in &#39;type&#39;. To sort people according to when their records were last edited you put &#39;last_edited&#39; in &#39;field&#39; and &#39;date&#39; in &#39;type&#39;. The &#39;direction&#39; subfield can have either &#39;1&#39; for forwards or &#39;-1&#39; for backwards. Try putting a &#39;1&#39; first, and if that does not give the desired results come back and change it to &#39;-1&#39;.<br />
<br />
When you hit the &#39;create&#39; button, a new dtd and xml file will be generated for the category in the &#39;xmlSiteEngine/system/xml/&#39; directory.<br />
<br />
After you create a new category you will also have to <a href="how_to12.html">create an index template</a>, <a href="how_to13.html">create a record template</a>, and <a href="how_to22.html">create a reference template</a> for each browser version of the site.</blockquote>
