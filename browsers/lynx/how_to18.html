<blockquote>To add a new field to a category, <a href="how_to2.html">go to the configure site page</a>.<br />
<br />
Fields that have no attributes or subfields will have a multi-line text box input. If a field has attributes, defined by entering a list of attribute names separated by a space in the &#39;attributes&#39; field, it will have a subfield with a single line text input for each attribute, but no multi-line text input. If a field has a subfield, it can still have attributes, but it will not have a multi-line text input.<br />
<br />
To create a new top-level field, follow the &#39;new field&#39; link next to the category you want to add a field to. To add a subfield to an existing field, follow the &#39;new child field&#39; link next to the field you want to add a subfield to. But be careful, because if a field has a multi-line text input, and you add a subfield to it, it will no longer have a multi-line text input, and any data that has been entered in records in that field will be lost. To add a single-line text input subfield to an existing field, follow the &#39;edit&#39; link next to that field and add a new attribute to the field, separated by a space from any existing attributes. Again, if the field you add an attribute to had a multi-line text input, it will be lost.<br />
<br />
All categories automatically have a title field if a title is defined when you <a href="how_to15.html">create a new category</a>, a &#39;record_number&#39; field, a &#39;subcategory&#39; field with &#39;name&#39; and &#39;rank&#39; subfields, and a &#39;last_edited&#39; field with &#39;month&#39;, &#39;day&#39;, &#39;year&#39; and &#39;by&#39; subfields. The title field and &#39;subcategory&#39; field will be visible when you <a href="how_to4.html">edit a record</a>. The &#39;record_number&#39; field is automatically assigned a value when you <a href="how_to3.html">create a new record</a>, and the filename of the page created for a record corresponds to its record number, for example if a person&#39;s record number is &#39;person2&#39;, then the filename of the page generated from their record will be &#39;person2.html&#39;. The &#39;last_edited&#39; field is automatically updated every time you <a href="how_to4.html">edit a record</a>, and stores the month, day, year, and name of the person who edited the record.</blockquote>
