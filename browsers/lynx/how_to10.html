<blockquote>To change your password, go to your page. Everyone who has a password should have a page. Follow the change password link next to the edit link.<br />
<br />
You should see a page with four fields. Enter your name exactly as it appears on your page in the first field. In the next field put your current password. If this is the first time you have changed your password, your password should be the same as your name. Then enter what you want your password to be in the next to fields.<br />
<br />
If your password is successfully changed, you should be returned to the home page. If you get a blank change password form, then it didn&#39;t work.<br />
<br />
If it didn&#39;t work, make sure you enter your new password the same in both the new password and confirm password fields, and that you entered your name exactly as it appears on your page.</blockquote>
